Lynda Code Clinic courses - Lake Pend Oreilly data files

Simple Python script to create a set of folders and files similar to those existing previously at http://www.lpo.dt.navy.mil/data/DM.
It can be used for training purposes when studying some Lynda Code Clinic courses ("Code Clinic Python", "Code Clinic PHP").
A local ftp or http server can be used to serve them while working on "Lake Pend Oreilly" exercise.
